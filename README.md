# Dharma Tutorial 3

This repo contains the starter code for the third tutorial in the series "How To Build a dApp in 5 minutes".

You can find the tutorial [here](https://blog.dharma.io/build-your-first-dapp-in-5-minutes-part-iii-989a36fdf79e).
You’ll first want to clone the GitHub repo with the project starter code:

git clone https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/dharma-tutorial-3

From there, navigate to the project’s root directory:

cd dharma-tutorial-3

And install the project’s dependencies:

npm install

Once installed, run the command below to boot up a local blockchain:

npm run blockchain

Once the blockchain is booted up, you’ll want to open a new terminal window and serve the frontend application from your project’s root directory:

cd dharma-tutorial-3 && npm start
